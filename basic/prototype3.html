    // like all functions, ObjMaker has an accessible prototype property that 
    // we can alter. I just added a property called 'b' to it. Like 
    // all objects, ObjMaker also has an inaccessible [[prototype]] property
    // that we can't do anything with

    obj1 = new ObjMaker();
    // 3 things just happened.
    // A new, empty object was created called obj1.  At first obj1 was the same
    // as {}. The [[prototype]] property of obj1 was then set to the current
    // object value of the ObjMaker.prototype (if ObjMaker.prototype is later
    // assigned a new object value, obj1's [[prototype]] will not change, but you
    // can alter the properties of ObjMaker.prototype to add to both the
    // prototype and [[prototype]]). The ObjMaker function was executed, with
    // obj1 in place of this... so obj1.a was set to 'first'.

    console.log(obj1.a);
    // returns 'first'
    console.log(obj1.b);
    // obj1 doesn't have a property called 'b', so JavaScript checks 
    // its [[prototype]]. Its [[prototype]] is the same as ObjMaker.prototype
    // ObjMaker.prototype has a property called 'b' with value 'second'
    // returns 'second'

    SubObjMaker = function() {};
    SubObjMaker.prototype = new ObjMaker(); // note: this pattern is deprecated!
    // Because we used 'new', the [[prototype]] property of SubObjMaker.prototype
    // is now set to the object value of ObjMaker.prototype.
    // The modern way to do this is with Object.create(), which was added in ECMAScript 5:
    // SubObjMaker.prototype = Object.create(ObjMaker.prototype);

    SubObjMaker.prototype.c = 'third';
    obj2 = new SubObjMaker();
    // [[prototype]] property of obj2 is now set to SubObjMaker.prototype
    // Remember that the [[prototype]] property of SubObjMaker.prototype
    // is ObjMaker.prototype. So now obj2 has a prototype chain!
    // obj2 ---> SubObjMaker.prototype ---> ObjMaker.prototype

    console.log(obj2.c);
    // returns 'third', from SubObjMaker.prototype

    console.log(obj2.b);
    // returns 'second', from ObjMaker.prototype

    console.log(obj2.a);
    // returns 'first', from SubObjMaker.prototype, because SubObjMaker.prototype 
    // was created with the ObjMaker function, which assigned a for us
